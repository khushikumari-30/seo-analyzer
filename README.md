# SEO Analyzer 

This is a simple web application, I created for my coding task.

It checks how easy or difficult your text is to read. After you enter your text and click "Submit", it shows a readability score, grade level, and some extra information like:

- Number of words
- Number of sentences
- Reading time
- Speaking time
- And more!

# What It Does

ðŸ”¹ You enter your text  
ðŸ”¹ Click "Submit Text"  
ðŸ”¹ The app sends your text to the backend  
ðŸ”¹ The backend calls an API (ApyHub Readability API)  
ðŸ”¹ The result is sent back and shown on the screen
